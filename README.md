# Project Workflow

## Client Meeting
- Understand the client's needs, goals, and timelines.
- Create a detailed project brief that outlines the deliverables.

## Wireframes & User Flows (UI/UX Team)
### UI/UX Meeting with Product Owner:
- Discuss initial wireframes and user flows.
- Make sure what is designed meets the client's needs. If it looks good, show it to the client for their feedback.
- Share the document with the client before the meeting so they can read and already have an idea of what it's about.

## Dev Team Meeting
### Insights About the Project:
- Everyone on the dev team and UI/UX team shares what they think about the project and how they will build it.
- Discuss any changes or adjustments with the product owner.
- Everyone takes notes, especially on changes to logic or design.

## First Stage (Validation) – 1-3 Days
### Dev Team Technical Discussion:
- Validate if the dev team and UI/UX team are aligned on the project's direction.
- The technical team may have questions to clarify requirements.
- Discuss the tech stack, how frontend expects to work with the backend, and break the project into milestones.
- Add a brief about what each milestone should deliver.
- Start discussing data formats and the flow from backend to frontend.

### DYOR: (Do Your Own Research)
- If the team isn't sure about something, research and come back to adjust things.

### Backend Tasks
- Break milestones into tasks based on user stories.
- Discuss what tech they'll use and if they have existing modules to reuse.
- Add all tasks to the Kanban board and prioritize them.

### Frontend Tasks
Same process as the backend:
- Define their tech stack and add tasks related to frontend development.

## Second Stage (Big Picture & Details) – 1-3 Days
- After discussions with the UI/UX team and product owner, go over user stories and confirm with the client.
- Show the flow and get approval before moving forward.

## Third Stage (Build, Test, Deliver, and Repeat) – 1-3 Days
### Frontend:
- Start building based on mock data similar to what will come from the backend.
- Split tasks so that each team member works on complete user stories (like fonts, colors, and UI elements).

### Backend:
- Start building the initial work (like setting up the database schema and middleware).
- Split tasks so that each team member works on complete user stories.

### Initial Work
#### Backend:
- Deliver the API or data format and test it before handing it to the frontend. Provide proper documentation.

#### Frontend:
- Integrate and test the API. If changes are needed, assign issues to the developer working on that feature.

### Backend Issues
- This process improves communication. It helps us understand where problems are happening before merging to the main branch.
- When frontend developers need something from the backend, they can look at the related pull request (PR) and see how it integrates with their work.
- If everything looks good, start merging to the main branch.

### Deliver & Repeat
- In weekly meetings, the frontend team shows what they've worked on.
- The backend team shares their progress and what they are working on next.
- Repeat the process and enhance based on feedback.

# Devolpers Mainfesto 

### 1. Keep Things Simple and Organized
   - Separate frontend and backend work to reduce complexity.
   - Use a clear, easy-to-follow branching strategy.
   - Implement small pull requests and focused tasks to keep everything manageable.

### 2. Learn Together Through Pair Programming and Code Reviews
   - Pair up often, whether it's frontend with backend or junior with junior, to learn from each other.
   - Treat code reviews as a collaborative learning process, not just a quality check.

### 3. Document Everything Clearly
   - Maintain well-documented APIs, processes, and workflows.
   - Ensure everyone stays on the same page and can quickly understand the project as it evolves.
   - Facilitate easier task revisiting and issue solving through thorough documentation.

### 4. Start Small and Build Up
   - Break down tasks into small, understandable pieces.
   - Use mock data early to keep the frontend moving while the backend develops.
   - Ensure each piece fits into the bigger picture.

### 5. Embrace Feedback, Celebrate Wins, and Learn From Mistakes
   - Conduct regular feedback sessions to track progress and identify areas for improvement.
   - Celebrate small successes to maintain high motivation.
   - Create an environment where it's safe to make mistakes and learn from them.
